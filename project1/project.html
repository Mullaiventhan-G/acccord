                    <h3>Rohit Said,</h3>
                    <p>‚ÄúI have played so much cricket for Mumbai Indians. Mumbai is the place where I have started my cricket career. So, this city is very, very special. I am happy to be here. We haven‚Äôt had the best of the season in the last two or three years. But we are quite determined to change that. We will be looking forward to each other‚Äôs help. And hopefully, we can turn things around,‚Äù Rohit Sharma said before adding: ‚ÄúMumbai Indians has a rich history of winning trophies, winning games out of unbelievable situations. Since I have retired from the format, I think this is the perfect spot for me. The players who are representing the national team at the highest level should get the preference. It‚Äôs a very tough one when you come into a fresh auction and you start retaining players. With Mumbai, we have always tried maintaining a core group of players. Moving forward, I just feel that we can have a good auction and create a group of players who can be match-winners for us. We will put the right foot forward and bring the legacy back where it belongs.‚Äù</p>
                </div>
                <div  class="a1d">
                    <h3>Pandiya Said,</h3>
                    <p>"5 people who we all have cherished a lot of good memories, together. We are as one. We are five fingers but one fist, that's how I look at it. We are going to come all guns blazing, brotherhood, friendship and at the same point of time we are going to back each other no matter what happens,"It has been fantastic. I have been loved back. Everything what I have achieved in my life has been part of Mumbai Indians. Every year is a special year and this is going to be an even more special one. We remember as a group in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. I think all of our fans know what happened in those years, and we are going to come back in 2025 even stronger than that."You lose and win on the ground. It is just preparation. I like to work hard, like to prepare well, and I think God has been really kind to me. Have put me in situations where I was able to hold my nerves, and you know something special has come out," Hardik said.</p>

                <div  class="a1d">
                    <h3>Bumrah Said,</h3>
                    <p>"We understand that we live in a country where emotion is really the talking point. It's an emotion-driven country. We understand that fans do get emotional, and players are also emotional," Bumrah stated. He acknowledged the impact of fan reactions on players, especially when playing in front of a home crowd.
                        The fast bowler emphasized the difficulty of ignoring negative comments and boos, despite recognizing the necessity to do so.
                        "It's not that simple saying 'just don't focus on it.' They're screaming, and you can hear it, but then, the inner circle helps you. We, as a team, don't encourage that, we don't promote that, we don't think that is warranted," Bumrah said.
                        Bumrah highlighted the significance of team support and family during such times. "Now, the world can think what they want to. We as a team were talking to him, if he needed support, his family will always be there. Certain things are beyond your control. If it happens, it happens."</p>

                <div  class="a1d">
                    <h3>Surya Said,</h3>
                    It is understood that Suryakumar wanted to know what plans the franchise had for him for the future. Having replaced Rohit as the India T20I captain after the T20 World Cup, Suryakumar is keen to lead MI, too, at some point. The franchise has told him that when Hardik replaced Rohit as captain ahead of the 2024 season, the plan was to see him continue in that position at least for the foreseeable future.The franchise is believed to have asked Suryakumar if he had any conditions before retention and also that they wouldn't be able to promise him anything. Suryakumar told the franchise, later, that he wanted to stay with MI. He is also believed to have told the franchise that he does have captaincy aspirations. This was on October 4, about four weeks before the retention deadline.

                    <h3>Tilak Said,</h3>
                    <p>‚ÄúI have been doing what my franchisee Mumbai Indians has been looking for from my side. Focussing on the team‚Äôs needs and trying to be consistent. Whatever role I am assigned I am ready for the challenge,‚Äù‚ÄúThankfully, Mumbai Indians has been a great franchise for me, always backing me right from the start, mostly playing me in the eleven which is itself a huge morale-booster. With Rohit Sharma bhai being such a successful captain and also my childhood idol, I have been in such a comfort zone, and I am lucky to have played under him,Definitely, my performances with Mumbai Indians did help me in the process of being picked for the Indian team Frankly, there were no real big changes in my game after joining Mumbai Indians. A little bit of maturity, a different mindset playing with seniors and also interacting with other big players from different franchisees helped me a lot</p>
